# imgui-template

A template to get started with a new imgui application (the docking branch), using GLFW and OpenGL3 as backends.

After cloning the repository, execute 'make' to compile all backends and imgui library files, then you can ran the application using 'make run'. You can also test for memory leaks using 'make memtest' to run the application using Valgrind.

If you add any new source file or library, make sure to update the makefile accordingly!
